	<h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>

	<h2>Okay this part is Amy's</h2>

<div> There is no other reason besides functionality that Amy Cheng has her own page. You might think that she deserves one because she's so awesomesauce or maybe not but it was too much of a pain in the ass to figure out how to STOP the alternating left and right for this one specific message. And also I didn't know how to do lists and stuff... Anyways here's amy: <div>

	<p>There is no real way of putting into words how grateful I am to have met you and hung out with you. I know we do not talk all that much (this is not helped by us sharing one class together), and I wish we would speak and hang out much more (I wish you would have stayed in philosophy, but alas, you do not like to torture yourself, which is a big crime).</p>

  <p> I know that you are often stressed about the many things in your life, as I am sure that one million things always appear to be happening at the same time, but please slow down and take time for yourself, which is something that seems impossible these days.</p>

  <p>Please know that you are amazing, and there are MANY reasons why: </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>1) You are so, so, so kind!</strong> I am always blown away by your understanding and kindness to everyone. I am not the biggest extrovert, so it was very calming to sit next to you during Charlie's party and talk in a gentler manner. You are also well known to many of my band friends, who (IDK if you know) only have kind words to say about you. Please never lose that aspect of yourself! </li>

    <li><strong>2) You are so good at theory!</strong> Please, please help me clutch up my theory skills. I can help you with literally any other class, but please help with theory ;) </li>

    <li> <strong>3) You can match everyone's vibe while maintaining your own energy.</strong> You are able to express yourself and blend in with others at the same time. You handled the Ms. Reinhart situation with such maturity while allowing others to share their opinions. This is becoming rarer and rarer in this world. Please never change.</li>

    <li> <strong>4) You fight for what you believe in.</strong> I know I did not attend the trans rights walkouts, and I am deeply sorry for that. I don’t have an excuse, and I won’t make one. You stood up, reached out, and even invited me to join, which was so kind. Please keep fighting for what you believe in (and stay safe while doing so). </li>

    <li><strong>5) YOU ARE EVAN, AND THAT ALONE IS A REASON TO APPRECIATE YOU!</strong> You should love yourself for who you are.</li>
  </ol>

  <p> Thank you for being so kind to me, and happy 17th birthday! HMU if you want a free basic neuroscience lesson, cat pics, or anything else; my phone is always open.</p>

  <p>Best of luck in all your future anythings and everythings!</p>
