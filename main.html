<img class="image_sidebar" src = "_images/chevan-kiss.jpg"> <p> Happy birthday!!!!! I believe that your birthday is meant to celebrate YOU: all youve done all your trials and tribulations and for everyone you love to come and give you shit. My gift is this virtual card to you because not enough paper in the world can contain me, however my shitass coding capabilities can (and will). For 209 days i have loved you and for 209 more i will love you. Have I mentioned I love you. Anywho I made this little website using some shitass HTML and got a bunch of your friends to tell me exactly what they like about you and all of their favourite things and stuff. I got I like 20 people to send me messages ranging from people all across the planet (three or so cities). Getting all of these people's things into a easily readible format was a little bit of a pain in the behind and also writing all of the HTML code was also hard. In hindsight I should've just used wordpress instead of handwriting all of this nonsense but how else would I have gotten this awesome 90s aestheic that kinda looks like shit? I think it was worth it in the end because I like love you or something... Happy happy birthday and although the time we have left is quickly coming to an end, I am so so glad I got to meet you and you are so lovely and so so beautiful and omg im gonna cry youre so hot. I love you tons big guy. ANYWAYS The rest of the message is just me listing out some of my favourite things of yours because I couldn't stretch my message long enough. Not that I don't have things to say! I just can't articulate shit good. 

<li>		➡ I like your hair a lot. The dyed bits always grow on me and it's always better than it was before</li>
<li>		➡ Your kisses and hugs are always very nice. I know youre not the most of physical people out there but I always enjoy when you give me a big ol hug and give me your big ol love. I think I'm gay.</li>
<li>		➡ How talented you are! I hate how good you are at everything you do. I will kill you and wear your skin and become you but also no because i like looking at you too much</li>
<li>		➡ How gentle and accepting you are. I won't get into this</li>
<li>		➡ I like you more than Reinhardt likes saying the N-Word</li>
<li>		➡ I like you more than Hagan also likes saying the N-Word</li>
<li>		➡ I'll love you until the moon explodes and I die in a firey explosion</li>
